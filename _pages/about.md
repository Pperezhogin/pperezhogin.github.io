I am a Postdoctorate Associate at [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/), New York University, working with [Prof. Laure Zanna](https://laurezanna.github.io/), and as a part of [M2LInES](https://m2lines.github.io/) project. I am working on apllication of Machine Learning methods (generative ML, physics informed ML, equation discovery) to subgrid parameterizations of mesoscale eddies and their implementation to ocean models.

Previously, I obtained my PhD at Marchuk Institute of Numerical Mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences ([INM RAS](https://www.inm.ras.ru/en/)) in Moscow, under a supervision of [Dr. Andrey Glazunov](http://old.inm.ras.ru/persons/gav.htm). My dissertation is devoted to development of stochastic and deterministic parameterizations of kinetic energy backscatter produced by mesoscale eddies with implementation to the NEMO ocean model ([In Russian](https://keldysh.ru/council/3/D00202403/perezhogin_pa_diss.pdf)).
