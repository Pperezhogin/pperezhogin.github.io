I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/), New York University, working with [Prof. Laure Zanna](https://laurezanna.github.io/), and as a part of [M2LInES](https://m2lines.github.io/) project. I am working on applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including generative ML, physics-informed ML, and equation-discovery models, to the parameterization of ocean mesoscale eddies, with a focus on their implementation in the global ocean models.

Previously, I obtained my PhD at Marchuk Institute of Numerical Mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences ([INM RAS](https://www.inm.ras.ru/en/)) in Moscow, under a supervision of [Dr. Andrey Glazunov](http://old.inm.ras.ru/persons/gav.htm). My dissertation is devoted to development of stochastic and deterministic parameterizations of kinetic energy backscatter produced by mesoscale eddies with implementation to the NEMO ocean model ([In Russian](https://pperezhogin.github.io/assets/pdf/perezhogin_pa_diss.pdf)).
